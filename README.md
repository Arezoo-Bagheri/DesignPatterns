# Simple Code for Design Patterns

## Overview

This repository contains simple implementations of various design patterns in C#/.NET. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design and can significantly improve the structure and maintainability of your code. This project serves as a reference for developers seeking to understand and apply design patterns in their own projects.

## Design Patterns Included

The following design patterns are implemented in this sample code:

1. **Factory Method Pattern**: Defines an interface for creating an object but leaves the choice of its type to the subclasses, creating instances of several derived classes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or your preferred C# development environment

### Running the Sample Code

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/liaghatmand/DesignPatterns.git

## Acknowledgments
